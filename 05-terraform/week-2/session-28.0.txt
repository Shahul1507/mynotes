                                    ------------------
note-link: (https://vijaycodes.hashnode.dev/terraform-multi-environment#heading-module-development)                                        
-------------------
{Module development
------------------
Module development in Terraform is the process of creating a directory that contains configuration files to group resources and create reusable components

DRY - do not repeat
  variables
  functions
  roles (ansible)

functions --> inputs and outputs, we call function. you can call infinite times

modules --> resource defnition and arguements are same. only values are different
            write code once and call them many times..
}            
{advantages
-----------
code reuse
updates are easy and centralised
best practices can be enforced
you can restrict user using few options as per project standards
}

VPC -->(Virtual private cloud)
------------------------------
{What is VPC ?
------------
    VPC is a private section of a public cloud infrastructure that allows users to provision and manage resources in a logically isolated network, providing customizable IP address ranges, subnets, and security settings.
}

{Why VPC is important ?
--------------------	
-->  {Isolation: 
     ----------
      VPC's provide a dedicated environment within the public cloud, keeping your resources separate from others. This enhances security and minimizes the risk of data beaches.
     }

-->  {Scalability:
  ------------
      VPCs offer the ability to scale resources up or down based on demand, ensuring you can handle varying workloads without overprovisioning
     }

-->  {Cost Management:
  ----------------
      By controlling resources and configurations, you can optimize costs based on your specific usage and needs.
     }    

-->  {Enhanced Security:
  -----------------
      VPCs allow you to implement security measures such as firewalls, security groups, and network access control lists (ACLs) to control inbound and outbound traffic.
     }
}

{Components of VPC:
-----------------
-->{Internet Gateway : 
    ------------------
    This component allows resources in a public subnet to communicate with the internet. Internet gateway is attached to the vpc
   } 

-->{Subnets: 
    --------
    This component allows you to partition your vpc into smaller parts. Each subnet is defined by CIDR(classless interdomain routing) block . It defines the range of IP addresses available in that subnet.
   } 

-->{Route tables:
    -------------
    It is a set of rules that determines how traffic is directed within VPC. Each route table contains entries (routes) that define the destination IP address, the target and the routing behavior.
   }

-->{NAT(Network Address Translation) Gateway:
    -----------------------------------------
    It allows instances of private subnets connecting to Internet. NAT gateway is placed in public subnets.
   }

-->{Elastic IP:
    ----------
    It is attached to the NAT gateway as IP should not change every time
   }

-->{Security Groups:
   ----------------
    Firewalls that control traffic to and from individual instances. They allow you to specify rules based on IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
   }

}

{Manual VPC creation steps:
 ----------------------------- 
  
1. create VPC with 

    ---Name tag - optional  (expense_vpc)
    ---ipv4/CIDR ---> 10.0.0.0/16
     
2. creating subnets with


     for expense-public-subnet

    --VPC id - (expense_vpc) dropdown selection
    --Subnet name - (expense-public-subnet)
    -- Availability Zone - (us-east-1)
    --IPv4 subnet CIDR block - (10.0.1.0/24)

     for expense-private-subnet

     --VPC id - (expense_vpc) dropdown selection
    --Subnet name - (expense-private-subnet)
    -- Availability Zone - (us-east-1)
    --IPv4 subnet CIDR block - (10.0.2.0/24)


      for expense-database-subnet

     --VPC id - (expense_vpc) dropdown selection
    --Subnet name - (expense-database-subnet)
    -- Availability Zone - (us-east-1)
    --IPv4 subnet CIDR block - (10.0.3.0/24)

3.create Internet gateway

   -- Name tag -(expense-Internetgateway) --> create
   -- popup-Attach vpc --> select (expense_vpc)

4. create route table 

      for expense-public-route
    -- Name - optional -(expense-public-route)
    -- select VPC -- (expense-vpc) dropdown

   after creation click on edit routes --> search icon 0.0.0.0/0 --> Internet Gateway --> select (expense-Internetgateway)
   Navigate to subnet associations tab --> edit subnet associations --> select  check box -expense-public-subnet --> save associations

   for expense-private-route
    -- Name - optional -(expense-private-route)
    -- select VPC -- (expense-vpc) dropdown

  Navigate to subnet associations tab --> edit subnet associations --> select  check box -expense-private-subnet --> save associations

     for expense-database-route
    -- Name - optional -(expense-private-route)
    -- select VPC -- (expense-vpc) dropdown

  Navigate to subnet associations tab --> edit subnet associations --> select  check box -expense-database-subnet --> save associations 


5. creating Elastic Ip
   
   --> Allocate  elastic ip  --> allocate

6. Create nat gateway 

   -- Name - optional - (expense-project)
   -- Subnet -- (expense-public-subnet)
   -- Elastic IP allocation ID --( select created  Elastic ip) --> Create NAT gateway

7. connection establishment b/w NAT and private and database
  
   Navigate to route tables--> 

      -select Private route table --> edit routes --> search icon 0.0.0.0/0 --> NAT gateway --> select NAT ID --> Save changes

      -select database route table --> edit routes --> search icon 0.0.0.0/0 --> NAT gateway --> select NAT ID --> Save changes

Cloud resource with cloud account

It is a isolated datacenter in cloud. resources created inside vpc is completely private...

frontend server --> public must access this
backend server --> secure, public should not access this. dont create public ip and no internet
mysql server --> all users and orders data, cards, etc...dont create public ip and no internet

You have to seperate servers logically inside VPC...

subnetting

village name, pincode --> VPC name, CIDR
streets name, number --> subnets name, CIDR
roads --> routes
main road --> internet connection, internet gateway
main gate of house --> security group/firewall
house --> server

CIDR --> classless interdomain routing

192.178.3.4 --> 4 octates

255.255.255.255 --> Max IP

10.0.0.0/16 --> CIDR

total IP address bits are 32. possible IP address are 2^32

10.0.0.1
10.0.0.2
.
.
.
10.0.0.255

10.0.1.0
10.0.1.1
.
.
.
10.0.1.255

2^16 = 65,536

10.0.0.0/24 --> first 3 are blocked

10.0.0.255

10.0.1.0/24 --> 10.0.1.0 ... 10.0.1.255
10.0.2.0/24 --> 10.0.2.0, 10.0.2.1 .... 10.0.2.255

10.0.1.0/32

VPC creation
subnet creation
igw creation

public and private subnet
-------------------------
subnet which has internet connection is called as public subnet. 
private/app subnet will not have internet connection as routes. 
database subnet is also called as private subnet

10.0.0.0/16 --> internal roads
steps:
------
create vpc
create igw and associate with VPC
create public, private and database subnets
create public, private and database route table
create routes inside route table
associate route tables with appropriate subnets
created elastic IP
created NAT gateway
added NAT routes in private and database subnets

secure servers can't be reached directly...this is incoming/ingress traffic
traffic from the servers ... outgoing/egress traffic

database --> yum install mysql-server --> outgoing

what is NAT --> this is the mechanism private servers connects to internet for outgoing traffic like packages installation, security patches downloads

NAT --> when server stops and starts IP address will change.It should have same IP always

static IP/ elastic IP

High availability 
-------------------
If data is available in more than one region in called - High availability

  For example :
  ------------
                hyderabad--> Region
                east hyderabad --> Avaliability Zone
                west hyderabad --> Avaliability Zone
  similarily: (expense- project)
  -------------
    1 public subnet in us-east-1a, 1 public subnet in us-east-1b
    1 private subnet in us-east-1a, 1 private subnet in us-east-1b
    1 database subnet in us-east-1a, 1 database subnet in us-east-1b


EC2 Module
------------
it should accept count/instance_names
use instance_names inside tags

Interview Questions
-------------------
- How do you implement multiple environments in Terraform..?

- What is the public subnet and private subnet ..?

    [A] subnet which has internet connection is called as -public subnet.
        private/app -subnet will not have internet connection as routes.
        database subnet is also called as private subnet


- What is NAT ..?
  ------------
    [A] Mechanism in which private servers connect to the internet for outgoing traffic,
        like package installation, 
        security patches download, etc
